# Recruitment App Flow - Non-Technical Guide

## 1. What this app is for

This app helps Studio Lotus run hiring end-to-end in one place:
- create and publish openings
- collect applications
- review candidates
- run interviews and sprints
- send offers
- collect joining documents
- mark final hires

Think of it as a single recruitment pipeline tracker with built-in communication and file collection.

---

## 2. Who uses the app and what each role does

`HR Admin`:
- full control of recruitment operations
- approves offers
- can access reports and all candidate records

`HR Exec`:
- day-to-day candidate handling
- creates candidates, updates stages, schedules interviews, assigns sprints
- sends offers (after approval)

`Hiring Manager / GL / Interviewer`:
- interviews assigned candidates
- submits interview feedback and assessments
- views relevant candidate records

`Approver`:
- works on offer approval responsibilities

`Viewer`:
- read-only access

`Superadmin`:
- advanced override rights
- manages platform roles/people and special system-level actions

---

## 3. The full recruitment journey (high level)

1. Opening is created or requested
2. Candidate enters pipeline (public apply or manual HR entry)
3. Candidate receives links to complete forms
4. HR reviews profile and screening details
5. Candidate may receive a sprint assignment (if required)
6. Interviews happen (L2/L1 as applicable)
7. Offer is prepared, approved, and sent
8. Candidate accepts/declines offer
9. Joining documents are collected if accepted
10. Candidate is marked hired once all final checks are complete

---

## 4. Opening process

How openings start:
- HR can directly create an opening.
- A manager/requestor can submit an opening request.

Important behavior:
- Requested openings start as inactive.
- Only active openings appear on the public apply page.
- Opening code is auto-generated by the system.

---

## 5. How candidates enter the system

Two entry methods:
- Public application form (candidate applies directly)
- Manual candidate creation by HR

When a candidate is created, the system automatically:
- creates a candidate record and candidate code
- creates initial stage as `Enquiry`
- generates secure links for:
  - CAF form
  - Assessment form
- sends email with these links
- creates candidate Google Drive folder for documents
- logs all actions in activity timeline

---

## 6. Candidate forms: CAF and Assessment

Candidate typically receives two links:

`CAF`:
- basic screening details
- can expire after configured number of days
- once submitted, candidate is marked as in-progress

`Assessment`:
- detailed profile and competency information
- one-time submit
- includes role fit, experience, skills, references, declarations

Screening outcome labels used:
- `Green` - good fit based on available rule
- `Amber` - needs HR review
- `Red` - mismatch on key condition (for example relocation when mandatory)

Current practical behavior:
- system mostly supports HR-led review decisions after form submission
- final movement is typically driven by HR decisions in Candidate 360

---

## 7. Candidate stages you will see

Common pipeline stages:
- Enquiry
- HR Screening
- L2 Shortlist
- L2 Interview
- L2 Feedback
- Sprint
- L1 Shortlist
- L1 Interview
- L1 Feedback
- Offer
- Joining Documents
- Hired / Declined / Rejected

Important:
- only one stage is treated as current active stage
- every stage change is logged in timeline
- some transitions are blocked if required prerequisites are missing

---

## 8. HR review and candidate movement

From Candidate 360, HR can:
- view complete candidate profile, stages, history, and docs
- move candidate to next stage
- reject or close candidate
- issue/reissue public links (CAF/assessment flow support)
- schedule interviews or slot invites
- assign sprint tasks
- create and manage offers
- upload joining documents (internal upload option)

Guardrails:
- moving too far ahead can be blocked until required forms are submitted
- some skip/override actions are restricted to superadmin

---

## 9. Interview process

Two ways to schedule:

`Direct scheduling by HR`:
- HR selects interviewer and time
- candidate and interviewer get confirmation emails
- calendar invite can be created automatically

`Slot invite flow`:
- system proposes available slots
- candidate selects preferred slot through secure link
- selected slot is confirmed and other options expire

After interview:
- interviewer marks status (`taken` or `not taken`)
- interviewer/GL submits assessment form (L1/L2)
- feedback is locked after submission
- candidate stage moves to feedback stage when interview is taken

If interview is cancelled/rescheduled:
- emails are sent to candidate and interviewer
- calendar entries are updated when enabled

---

## 10. Sprint process (take-home assignment)

Step-by-step:
- HR assigns sprint template to candidate
- candidate gets public sprint link
- candidate sees instructions + attachments
- candidate uploads final sprint file
- reviewer evaluates score/comments/decision

Review decisions:
- `Advance` -> candidate moves forward in pipeline
- `Reject` -> candidate moved to rejected path

Automatic reminders:
- reminder before due date
- overdue follow-up if still pending

---

## 11. Offer process

Offer lifecycle:
- HR creates draft offer
- draft is submitted for approval
- approver/HR admin approves or sends back for changes
- approved offer is sent to candidate
- candidate accepts or declines via secure public link

Candidate-facing items:
- offer details page
- downloadable offer PDF (secure link)

When accepted:
- candidate is moved to Joining Documents stage

When declined:
- candidate is moved out of active hiring path (decline/reject handling is recorded in system)

---

## 12. Joining document process

After offer acceptance:
- candidate uploads required joining documents through secure link
- HR can also upload documents internally on candidate’s behalf

Required document types:
- PAN
- Aadhaar
- Marksheets
- Experience letters
- Salary slips

Status tracking:
- `None` - no documents
- `Partial` - some required docs missing
- `Complete` - all required docs uploaded

---

## 13. Final hire conversion

Candidate can be marked hired only when:
- offer is accepted
- required joining docs are complete

At finalization:
- candidate status becomes hired
- stage changes to Hired
- folder management updates happen in Drive (appointed bucket handling)

---

## 14. Automatic emails and reminders sent by system

Typical automated communication:
- candidate creation email (CAF link)
- assessment form email (sent when moved to L2 shortlist)
- CAF reminder
- sprint assignment email
- sprint reminder / sprint overdue reminder
- interview slot invite
- interview scheduled / rescheduled / cancelled emails
- interview feedback reminder to interviewer
- offer sent email
- offer follow-up reminder if no response

All email attempts are logged in candidate activity.

---

## 15. File handling in simple terms

Each candidate gets a Drive folder.

The app stores:
- application documents (CV, portfolio)
- sprint submissions and sprint assets
- offer letter PDFs
- joining documents

Folder can move based on outcome:
- Appointed (hired)
- Not Appointed (closed/declined path)

---

## 16. Dashboard and reporting

Dashboard gives live operational metrics such as:
- total applications
- active candidates
- new applications (today and last 7 days)
- candidates needing review
- candidates stuck in stage
- feedback pending
- sprint overdue
- offers awaiting response
- stage-wise candidate counts

Reports allow HR admin to preview/download CSV for:
- candidates
- openings
- interviews
- sprints
- offers

---

## 17. Common real-world scenarios

`Candidate applied but not visible in progress stage`:
- check whether CAF/assessment is submitted
- check whether required reviewer/owner details are assigned

`Candidate did not pick interview slot`:
- HR can cancel active invite and schedule directly

`Offer sent but no response`:
- system sends follow-up reminder based on configured delay

`Joining docs incomplete`:
- candidate stays in joining document stage until required list is complete

`Need to bypass standard flow`:
- superadmin can perform certain override actions

---

## 18. Daily operating checklist for HR teams

1. Check dashboard for overdue and pending items.
2. Review new applications and ensure forms are submitted.
3. Push shortlisted candidates to interviews/sprints without delay.
4. Track pending interview feedback and close loops quickly.
5. Move approved offers out promptly and monitor candidate response.
6. Follow up on joining doc gaps before expected joining date.
7. Close final conversions to hired status after all checks.

## 19. One-line process summary

Opening -> Candidate entry -> Forms -> HR screening/review -> Sprint/interviews -> Offer -> Joining docs -> Hired.

## 20. Current System Capacity (Real Measured Numbers)

Measured on:
- February 9, 2026

How this was measured:
- Live backend process running on `127.0.0.1:8002`
- Read-only API calls only
- Single backend worker (`workers=1`)
- 5-second load runs at 5, 10, and 15 concurrent users

Measured throughput with 0% errors:

| API | Throughput |
|---|---:|
| `GET /health` | 704 to 1334 requests/second |
| `GET /apply` | 493 to 557 requests/second |
| `GET /apply/{opening_code}` | 505 to 570 requests/second |

Plain-language takeaway:
- In the current setup, simple public read APIs are safely handling around `500+ requests/second`.
- This does not mean every endpoint can do the same.

Important:
- Complex actions (candidate apply submit, uploads, interviews, offers, external email/calendar/drive calls) will handle fewer requests per second.
- Some endpoints intentionally have protection limits (for example auth and public apply anti-abuse throttles).
