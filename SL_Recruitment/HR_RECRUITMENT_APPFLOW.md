Recruitment App Guide (Plain Language)

This guide explains the recruitment process in very simple terms. It is written for non?technical readers.

----------------------------------------
1) What this app does
----------------------------------------
- It helps HR manage job openings and candidates from start to finish.
- Candidates apply online, HR reviews them, interviews are scheduled, offers are sent, and joining documents are collected.
- The system keeps a timeline of everything that happened.

----------------------------------------
2) Who uses it
----------------------------------------
- HR Admin: Full control.
- HR Exec: Day?to?day HR tasks.
- Hiring Manager: Reviews candidates and interviews.
- Interviewer / Group Lead: Gives interview feedback.
- Viewer: Read?only.

----------------------------------------
3) The journey of a candidate (simple flow)
----------------------------------------
Think of each candidate moving through a set of steps. Only one step is ?current? at a time.

Step 1: Opening is ready
- HR creates a job opening.
- Only active openings appear to candidates.

Step 2: Candidate enters
Two ways:
A) Candidate applies on the website.
B) HR manually adds a candidate.

What the system does automatically:
- Creates a record for the candidate.
- Creates a Drive folder for their files.
- Sends a CAF link (a form the candidate must fill).

Step 3: CAF form (Candidate Application Form)
- Candidate fills and submits the CAF.
- The system checks basic fit and gives a result:
  - Green = good fit, auto?advance.
  - Red = not a fit, auto?reject.
  - Amber = needs HR review.

Step 4: HR review
- HR checks the candidate details, CV, and CAF answers.
- HR decides whether to move the candidate forward or reject.

Step 5: Sprint (optional task)
- HR can assign a take?home task.
- Candidate submits a file or a link.
- HR reviews and decides:
  - Advance to interview.
  - Reject.

Step 6: Interviews (L1 / L2)
- HR schedules interviews.
- Candidate and interviewer receive email invites.
- Interviewer submits feedback.
- HR decides next step.

Step 7: Offer
- HR creates the offer.
- Offer is approved and sent to the candidate.
- Candidate accepts or declines.

Step 8: Joining documents
- After acceptance, candidate uploads required documents.
- HR can also upload on their behalf.

Step 9: Hired
- Once all documents are complete, HR converts the candidate to an employee.

----------------------------------------
4) What HR sees as ?stages?
----------------------------------------
Stages are just labels for where the candidate is in the process.
Common stages you will see:
- enquiry (auto)
- hr_screening
- l2_shortlist or l2
- sprint
- l1_shortlist
- l1_feedback
- l2_feedback
- joining_documents
- hired
- rejected / declined

You do NOT need to remember these names. In the UI, you will simply see the current step for each candidate.

----------------------------------------
5) Automatic emails sent by the system
----------------------------------------
- CAF link (after candidate is created)
- CAF reminder (if candidate does not fill the form)
- Sprint assignment + reminders
- Interview schedule to candidate and interviewer
- Interview feedback reminder to interviewer
- Offer sent + offer follow?up

----------------------------------------
6) Where files go
----------------------------------------
- Each candidate has a Drive folder.
- CV, sprint files, offer PDF, and joining documents are stored there.

----------------------------------------
7) Common HR questions (simple answers)
----------------------------------------
Q: Why is a candidate stuck in screening?
A: Their CAF was not submitted or the system marked it ?needs review?. HR must decide.

Q: What happens after offer acceptance?
A: Candidate uploads joining documents, then HR completes hiring.

Q: Can HR skip steps?
A: Yes, but only Superadmin can do it.
